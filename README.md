a lot of cross platform games and applications macos have absolutely atrocious latency, but not this demo.
you should see a near constant 60 fps with perfect os-application mouse syncronization while vsync is on. If not tell me what you see and on what os veriosn.
there can be A frame spike especially soon after launch, but it should go away if you set frames in flight to 2
